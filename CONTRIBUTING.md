## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.9+
- Git
- Poetry

### Installing Poetry

To install Poetry, use the following command:

```sh
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ConsortiumGARR/tcs-garr
    cd tcs-garr
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

3. **Activate Virtual Environment**:

    ```sh
    poetry shell
    ```

4. **Verify package installation**:

    ```sh
    tcs-garr --help
    ```

## Style Guide

Please follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. We use `ruff` for linting and formatting to maintain code quality. `Ruff` is automatically installed by Poetry when you install the project dependencies.

To run `ruff` for linting and formatting:

```sh
ruff check .  # Check for PEP 8 compliance and linting issues
ruff format .  # Automatically format code
```

Ensure your code is free of linting errors and properly formatted before committing your changes.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

This project uses `pre-commit` hooks to ensure code quality. The `poetry-pre-commit-plugin` is automatically install and configure Git Hooke when you run `poetry install` based on `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file.

Install and activate the hooks:

```sh
poetry self add poetry-pre-commit-plugin
poetry run pre-commit install
poetry run pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg -hook-type pre-push
```

Pre-commit will check only the modified files by default. If you want to check all files (recommended after cloning the repository), run:

```sh
poetry run pre-commit run --all-files
```

These hooks will run automatically on every commit to check code formatting, linting, and other quality checks.
