## Overview

The `TCS-GARR Client` is a command-line tool for managing and interacting with Harica
platform. It offers features like listing, downloading, issuing certificates, approving
requests, and generating domain validation tokens, all via the Harica API.

## Warning ⚠️

**Consortium GARR is not affiliated with HARICA, and the present work has not been
endorsed by or agreed with HARICA.**

**Consortium GARR provides this code to the community for sharing purposes but does not
commit to providing support, maintenance, or further development of the code. Use it at
your own discretion.**

### Prerequisites

Before using the TCS-GARR client, please ensure the following:

1. **Create a local account on the Harica platform**: You must create a local account on
   Harica at [https://cm.harica.gr](https://cm.harica.gr). Do not use federated IDEM
   credentials, as they do not support API access.

   - If you're already logged in with an academic login, you can create a new local
     account using an email alias. Academic login users do not have a password and
     therefore cannot use the API.

2. **Required Roles and 2FA**: To use specific API commands, your account must have the
   appropriate roles and 2FA enabled where required. Check the [Command Roles and 2FA
   Requirements](#command-roles-and-2fa-requirements) section for details.

   - **Enable 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication)** on your profile page if you need to
     perform actions such as approving certificates or managing domain validation.

   - If administrative permissions are required (e.g., domain validation), request an
     existing administrator to elevate your account.

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ **Save the TOTP seed** after enabling 2FA, as you will need it for authentication.
> The TOTP seed follows the format `otpauth://totp/HARICA:username@domain.tld?secret=************&issuer=HARICA&digits=6`.

Once these steps are completed, you are ready to use the TCS-GARR client.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ⚠️ The OTP (One-Time Password) is generated based on the date and time of your PC. If
> the client fails to authenticate and returns an "Invalid OTP" error, please ensure that
> your device's date and time are correct and synchronized with a public NTP server.

### Command Roles and 2FA Requirements

**USER** is the default role assigned to a logged-in user with no special permissions
and who has not been granted any additional roles by an administrator.

Other roles, apart from **USER**, require 2FA and are provided by an administrator.

| Command  | Role Needed             | 2FA Needed |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| approve  | SSL_ENTERPRISE_APPROVER | ✔️          |
| cancel   | USER                    | ❌          |
| domains  | ENTERPRISE_ADMIN        | ✔️          |
| download | USER                    | ❌          |
| init     | None                    | ❌          |

| upgrade  | None                    | ❌          |
| validate | ENTERPRISE_ADMIN        | ✔️          |
| whoami   | USER                    | ❌          |

## Installation

You can install the TCS-GARR client in a virtual environment using `pip` or via `pipx`.

### Virtual Environment

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to
   install the package. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    mkdir <path>
    python -m venv venv
    ```

    This will create a folder named `venv` in your project directory, containing a
    self-contained Python environment.

2. Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the package

    ```bash
    pip install tcs-garr
    ```

### Pipx

1. Open a terminal and install the package

    ```bash
    PIPX_BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin pipx install tcs-garr
    ```

## Configuration

After installation, the first time you run the client, you will need to initialize the
configuration file with your credentials by running:

```bash
tcs-garr init
```

This will create a `tcs-garr.conf` file in your home directory under `.config/tcs-garr`
path. This file will contain your Harica username, password, TOTP seed, folder for
issued certificates, and HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings (if needed). The file will have secure permissions.

If a configuration file is not found, the system will notify you to initialize the
configuration using the `tcs-garr init` command.

### Updating Configuration

If you need to update your configuration (including adding or modifying proxy settings), you can use:

```bash
tcs-garr init --force
```

This will override existing parameters with new values. You can use this command to add or update HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can use the TCS-GARR client for various operations. The
command syntax follows this pattern:

```bash
tcs-garr [command] [options]
```

To view all available commands and options:

```bash
tcs-garr --help

usage: tcs-garr [-h] [--debug] [--version] [--no-check-release] [--environment {production,stg}] {approve,cancel,domains,download,init,k8s,list,request,revoke,upgrade,validate,whoami} ...

```

### Production and staging environments

All commands are executed on the production environment of Harica at
[https://cm.harica.gr](https://cm.harica.gr). By using the `--environment stg` flag, you
can execute commands for the staging environment at
[https://cm-stg.harica.gr](https://cm-stg.harica.gr).

For example, if you want to use the staging environment, you can initialize the
configuration file using the following command:

```bash
tcs-garr --environment stg init
```

### Available Commands

1. **Initialize configuration**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr init
   ```

   This command initializes the configuration file with your credentials (email,
   password, TOTP seed, output folder, and optional proxy settings).

   To update an existing configuration or add proxy settings:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr init --force
   ```

2. **Get user profile**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr whoami
   ```

   This command retrieves the profile of the logged-in user.

3. **List all certificates**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr list --help

   usage: tcs-garr list [-h] [--expired-since EXPIRED_SINCE] [--expiring-in EXPIRING_IN] [--status {Valid,Revoked,Expired,Pending,Ready,Completed,Cancelled,All}] [--user [USER]] [--fqdn FQDN] [--export]

   options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --expired-since EXPIRED_SINCE
                           List certificates whose expiry date is X days before now.
   --expiring-in EXPIRING_IN
                           List certificates whose expiry date is X days after now.
   --status {Valid,Revoked,Expired,Pending,Ready,Completed,Cancelled,All}
                           Filter certificates by status. Default is valid.
   --user [USER]         Filter certificates owner by user. Without arg (--user only) will filter for the logged in user. Use this if you have Approver role or Admin role.
   --fqdn FQDN           Filter certificates by a substring in their Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
   --export              Export certificates to json file.
   ```

   This command will list all available certificates. You can filter them by date range
   using the `--expired-since` and `--expiring-in` options.

4. **Download a certificate**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr download --help

   usage: tcs-garr download [-h] --id ID [--output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME] [--force] [--download-type {pemBundle,certificate}]

    options:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    --id ID               ID of the certificate to download.
    --output-filename OUTPUT_FILENAME
                            Optional filename to save the certificate inside default output_folder.
    --force, -f           Force overwrite if the output file already exists.
    --download-type {pemBundle,certificate}
                            Type of download: 'pemBundle' or 'certificate'. Default is 'pemBundle'.
   ```

   Replace `ID` with the ID of the certificate you wish to download. You can use
   `pemBundle` or `certificate` as arguments for specific download formats.

5. **Request a new certificate**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr request --help

   usage: tcs-garr request [-h] [--profile {OV,DV}] [--wait] (--csr CSR | --cn CN) [--alt_names ALT_NAMES]

   options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --profile {OV,DV}     Profile to use between OV or DV. Default: OV
   --wait                Wait for the certificate to be approved
   --csr CSR             Path to an existing CSR file.
   --cn CN               Common name of the certificate.
   --alt_names ALT_NAMES
                           Comma-separated alternative names (only used with --cn).
   ```

   The `request` command is used to submit a new certificate request to Harica.

   You can either provide an existing Certificate Signing Request (`--csr`) or specify
   the details for generating a new CSR, including the Common Name (`--cn`) and any
   Subject Alternative Names (`--alt_names`). If a new CSR is created using the `--cn`
   and `--alt_names` options, a private key will also be automatically generated.

   You can choose between the `OV` (OV Profile) or `DV` (DV Profile) profile using the
   `--profile` option. Default is `OV`.

   After submitting the certificate request, the request must be approved by another
   Administrator before the certificate can be downloaded. Ensure that an administrator
   is available to review and approve your request.

   With `--wait`` flag, the command will wait for the certificate to be approved by
   another administrator. When approved, it will be automatically downloaded.

6. **Approve a certificate**:

   ```bash
   usage: tcs-garr approve [-h] (--id ID | --list-pending | --all)

   options:
   -h, --help      show this help message and exit
   --id ID         ID of the certificates (comma separated) to approve.
   --list-pending  List all pending requests.
   --all           Approve all pending requests.
   ```

   You can list all pending requests using the `--list-pending` option or approve all
   pending requests using the `--all` option.

   You can also approve a specific certificate by providing its ID using the `--id`
   option.

7. **Cancel a certificate request**:

   ```bash
   tcs-garr cancel --help

   usage: tcs-garr cancel [-h] --id ID

   options:
   -h, --help  show this help message and exit
   --id ID     ID of the request to cancel.
   ```

   Replace `ID` with the ID of the certificate you wish to cancel.

8. **Generate validation token for domains**:

   ```bash
   usage: tcs-garr validate [-h] --domains DOMAINS

   options:
   -h, --help         show this help message and exit
   --domains DOMAINS  Comma separated list of domains.
   ```

   This command generates validation tokens for the specified domains. Replace `DOMAINS`
   with a comma-separated list of domains you need to validate.

   To get the list of all available domains in your organization, use the `domains`
   command.

   ```bash
   tcs-garr domains
   ```

9. **Upgrade package**:

   ```bash
   usage: tcs-garr upgrade [-h]

   options:
   -h, --help  show this help message and exit
   ```

   This command upgrades the package to the latest version.

10. **K8s resource**:

   This command is used to generate a Kubernetes secret YAML file for storing a TLS
   certificate and its associated private key. The resulting secret can be used in
   Kubernetes clusters to securely store TLS certificates for applications requiring
   encrypted communication.

   The command requires the paths to both the certificate file (--cert) and the private
   key file (--key), as well as the target Kubernetes namespace (--namespace) where the
   secret will be created.

   ```bash
   usage: tcs-garr k8s [-h] --cert CERT --key KEY --namespace NAMESPACE [--secret-name SECRET_NAME] [--file-name FILE_NAME]

   options:
   -h, --help            show this help message and exit
   --cert CERT           Path to the certificate file.
   --key KEY             Path to the key file.
   --namespace NAMESPACE
                           Kubernetes namespace for the secret.
   --secret-name SECRET_NAME
                           Name for the secret (optional).
   --file-name FILE_NAME
                           Name for the yaml file without the extension (optional).
   ```

11. **Revoke certificate**:

   ```bash
   usage: tcs-garr revoke [-h] --id ID

   options:
   -h, --help  show this help message and exit
   --id ID     ID of the certificate to revoke.
   ```
